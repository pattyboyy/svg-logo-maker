Navigate to the directory and install the dependencies. Once the installation is complete, you can run the application using the following command: "node index.js".

## Tests

To ensure the reliability and stability of the Logo Generator application, it is important to run tests before submitting any changes. The project includes a test suite to verify the functionality of the application. Follow these steps to run the tests: Make sure you have installed all the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory: "npm install". Run the test suite using the following command: "npm test". The test results will be displayed in the console, indicating the number of tests passed, failed, or skipped. If any tests fail, the console output will provide details about the specific test cases that failed and the reasons for the failure. Review the test results carefully. If any tests fail, investigate the cause of the failure and make necessary corrections to your code. If you have added new features or made significant changes to the existing codebase, it is recommended to add corresponding test cases to ensure the correctness of your changes. You can add new test files or modify existing ones in the test directory.
